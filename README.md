# Job_Portal_Website

It is an online job portal website which enables job seekers to access information about available jobs in the job market.
Here the Admin can efficiently manage job listings by posting, editing, and deleting jobs, as well as making them active or inactive. After logging in with the login credentials(static), the Admin gains access to the Admin page, where he/she can perform all these tasks.
Users can register, log in, and view all active jobs, with the option to filter jobs based on location and category. Users can also update their profile information.
But the ability of posting, deleting, and accessing inactive jobs are restricted to Admin.
